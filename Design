In recent years, the landscape of education has undergone a significant transformation with the proliferation of online learning platforms. While these platforms offer flexibility and accessibility, one challenge educators face is gauging the level of engagement among remote learners. Understanding the extent to which students are actively participating and engaged during online lectures is crucial for effective teaching and learning outcomes. 
To address this challenge, the "Facial Expressions to Estimate the Level of Engagement in Online Lectures" project proposes a novel solution leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques. By analyzing facial expressions captured during online lectures, the system aims to provide real-time insights into the engagement levels of individual students or the audience as a whole.

3.2 DFD/UML DIAGRAMS 
 
3.2.1 DFD Diagrams 
 
A DFD is a graphical representation of how the data flows through a system. Developing a DFD is one of the first steps carried out when developing an information system. DFD displays details like the data that is coming in and going out of the system, how the data is travelled through the system and how the data will be stored in the system. 
But the DFD does not contain information about timing information of the processes. The main components included in a DFD are processes, data stores, data flow and external entities. When developing DFD diagrams, the context level DFD is drawn first. It displays how the entire system interacts with external data sources and data sinks. 
Next a Level 0 DFD is developed by expanding the context level DFD. Level 0 DFD contains details of the sub-systems within the system and how the data is flowing through them. It also contains details about the data stores required within the system.
 
A Level 1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the "Analysis of Facial Expressions to Estimate the Level of Engagement in Online Lectures" project would provide a high-level overview of the system's functionalities and interactions at a basic level. 
 
This Level 1 DFD provides a simplified view of the system's processes and interactions without delving into too much detail. It serves as a useful starting point for understanding the flow of data and operations within the system. 
 
Depending on the complexity of the project, you may need to create more detailed DFDs at higher levels to further elaborate on individual processes and data flows. 
 
3.2.2 UML Diagrams 
 
UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. UML is a standardized general- purpose modeling language in the field of object-oriented software engineering. The standard is managed, and was created by, the Object Management Group. The goal is for UML to become a common language for creating models of object oriented computer software. In its current form UML is comprised of two major components: a Meta-model and a notation. In the future, some form of method or process may also be added to; or associated with, UML.The Unified Modeling Language is a standard language for specifying, Visualization, Constructing and documenting the artifacts of software system, as well as for business modeling and other non- software systems. The UML represents a collection of best engineering practices that have proven successful in the modeling of large and complex systems. 
 
3.2.2.1 Class Diagram 
 
In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among the classes. It explains which class contains information 

 
3.2.2.2 Use Case Diagram 
 
In UML, use-case diagrams model the behavior of a system and help to capture the requirements of the system. Use-case diagrams describe the high-level functions and scope of a system. These diagrams also identify the interactions between the system and its actors. The use cases and actors in use-case diagrams describe what the system does and how the actors use it, but not how the system operates internally. A use case diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of behavioral diagram defined by and created from a Use-case analysis. Its purpose is to present a graphical overview of the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals (represented as use cases), and any dependencies between those use cases. The main purpose of a use case diagram is to show what system functions are performed for which actor. Roles of the actors in the system can be depicted.To depict the system boundary, draw a box around the use case itself. 

UML Use case diagrams are ideal for: 
	Representing the goals of system-user interactions. 
	Defining and organizing functional requirements in a system. 
	Specifying the context and requirements of a system. 
 Modelling basic flow of events in a use case. 

3.2.2.3 Sequence Diagram 
 
A sequence diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a kind of interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order. It is a construct of a Message Sequence Chart. Sequence diagrams are sometimes called event diagrams, event scenarios, and timing diagrams. 
. Try drawing a sequence diagram to: 
 
	Represent the details of a UML use case. 
	Model the logic of a sophisticated procedure, function, or operation. 
	See how objects and components interact with each other to complete a process. 
	Plan and understand the detailed functionality of an existing or future scenario. 
 
3.2.2.4 Deployment Diagram 
 
A deployment diagram visualizes the physical deployment of software components in a system. It illustrates how software and hardware components are distributed across different nodes in a network and how they interact with each other to form a complete system. The primary purpose of a deployment diagram is to show the mapping of software components to the hardware components on which they run. 
	Nodes represent physical entities, such as hardware devices or servers, where components are deployed. They could be a computer, a server, a router, or any other device that can host software. 
 
	Components represent the software elements or modules that are deployed on nodes. 
These can be executable files, libraries, or other software artifacts. 
	Artifacts are physical files or data that are used or produced by components. They can include databases, configuration files, or any other data storage. 
	Associations show the relationships and connections between nodes and components. They indicate how components are deployed on specific nodes and how nodes interact with each other. 
	Communication paths depict the channels or network connections through which nodes communicate with each other. They show the flow of messages or data between nodes. 
 
 
3.2.2.5 Activity Diagram 
 
Activity diagrams are graphical representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration and concurrency. In the Unified Modeling Language, activity diagrams can be used to describe the business and operational step-by- step workflows of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control.Activity is a particular operation of the system. Activity diagrams are not only used for visualizing the dynamic nature of a system, but they are also used to construct the executable system by using forward and reverse engineering techniques. The only missing thing in the activity diagram is the message part. It does not show any message flow from one activity to another. Activity diagram is sometimes considered as the flowchart. Although the diagrams look like a flowchart, they are not. It shows different flows such as 
 
 
parallel, branched, concurrent, and single. An activity diagram portrays the control flow from a start point to a finish point showing the various decision paths that exist while the activity is being executed. The purpose of an activity diagram can be described as – 
	Draw the activity flow of a system. 
	Describe the sequence from one activity to another. 
	Describe the parallel, branched and concurrent flow of the system.
