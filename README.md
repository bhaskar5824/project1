# Analysis of Facial Expressions to estimate the level of engagement in online lecturers
The present study aimed to develop a method for estimating students’ attentional state from facial expressions during online lectures. Student engagement is a critical factor influencing academic success and overall learning outcomes. This research explores the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict student engagement in educational settings. We assumed that reaction time to such a stimulus would be longer when participants were focusing on the lecture compared with when they were not. In the experiment, the learner’s face was recorded by a video camera while watching a video lecture.

The proposed RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model is like a smart system. It watches how students interact with their learning stuff, like clicking, reading, or answering questions. This smart system looks at these actions one after another, in a sequence, to understand how students are involved. It then uses this understanding to predict and measure how much students are engaged in their learning activities automatically. So, it helps figure out if students are really into their online learning or not.
